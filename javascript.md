# JavaScript

## What is it?

JavaScript is a *just-in-time* compiled language with *first-class functions*

## Variables

Variables are containers that store data

### 4 Ways to declare a variable:

- ```var```

- ```let```

- ```const``` 

- And using nothing

### Example:

```
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
let z = x + y;
```

### When to use what

Use ```let``` if you think the variable can change. A general rule is to always declare variable with ```const``` otherwise.

### Identifiers

All **variables** must be identifies by unique IDs. It can be anything you want but you should keep it short and descriptive. Here are a few rules to follow:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, dollar signs

- Must begin with a letter

- Can begin with $ and _

- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)

- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used

## Assignment Operator

Use ```=``` as an assignment operator. This acts as a "is". x =(is) y

Note: = does not mean "equal to" use ```==```

## Declaring a Variable

```
let carName = "Volvo";
let oneHundred = 100;
```
