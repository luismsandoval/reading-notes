# Growth Mindset
## So what is it?
 A growth mindset is the belief that you can accomplish anything you want based on sheer will and effort alone. It's the idea to *embrace the suck*, and improvise, adapt and overcome any obstacle in your way. 
 
## Why have a growth mindset?
 Simple, having a growth mindest will help you accomplish more of your goals. And when you fail, you will get back up with a smile on your face knowing that you will do even better this time.
 
 ## "What if I don't feel like I have the right mindset?"
 ### Here are some tips to keep in mind:
 - **Always look forward to challenges.** Facing tough challenges will push your skills to the limit and only help. Never run away from a challenge.
 - **Always put forth close to max effort.** You will just regret it later if you do not. *No pain, no gain* amirite? ðŸ˜† 
 - **Take the time to criticize yourself.** Do some self reflecting and ask yourself, *"What did I do great today? And what did I do wrong? How can I fix it?"*
