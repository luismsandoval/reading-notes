## About Me

Hi everyone! My name is Luis Sandoval and I am a student at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA. I recently seperated from the United States Marine Corps in March 2021. I have always been obsessed with tech and its advances and I am passionate about building the web of the future. Please follow along on my journey as I become a fullstack web developer. :)
