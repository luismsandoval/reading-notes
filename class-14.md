## What google learned about teams

### What makes a good tean

There are two common behaviors of that good teams generally share.

- Members speak roughly the same amount.

- The teams have high *average social sensitivity*

If only one or a few people on a team are speaking, the collective intelligence declines.

Average social sensitivity just means that the team members could intuitively tell how others were feeling based on their expressions.

Basically you just have to be good peoples, and make your team a comfortable place for all its members to express themselves freely. This is when everyone is at their best.
