## Images

### Sizing images with CSS

To control the size of an image you can use height and width properties using CSS. Below are some commonly used sizes on all pages.

```
Small portrait: 220 x 360
Small landscape: 330 x 210
Feature photo: 620 x 400
```

### Aligning images

We can use the float property to align an image in its containing block to allow text to flow around it.

### Centering images

To center an image on a webpage, first we must change it to a block-level element, since it is inherently inline. After that, we can either use `text-align: center` an the containing element or `margin: auto` the image itself.
