## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?

   - Functional programming is a *"programming paradigm that treats computation as the evalutation of mathematical functions and avoids changinf-state"* So functions that do not change the state or mutate data?

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

   - A pure function is a function that gives you the same result everytime you pass it that same argument.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

   - The code is easier to test with different contexts.

4. What is immutability?

   - Immutability is when *its state cannot change after it's created*

5. What is Referential transparency?

   - When a function yields the same result for the same input.

## NodeJS - Modules and `require()`

1. What is a module?

   - Logical modules. A JS file that has a singular functionality.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?

   - require is a way to connect data/functions from different modules.

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

   - `module.exports` is used to select whatever you want to bring over. Then we use `require('./path') to set it as a variable in the module where we want it.

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

   - `module.exports = whatever we want exported`
