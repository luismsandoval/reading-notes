## Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

### Consider the history

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

   - Personal computers started showing up in homes. But computer ads were targeted at boys sort of like toy tool kits and such.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

   - By the time they were old enough for University, personal computers became more common. Generally boys who grew up with personal computers had a clear advantage over the girls who did not.

### Ask the question

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

   - Diversity efforts are most successful when *company leaders* take charge in a meaningful way.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

   - Because diverse groups of people see problems from different perspectives, thus finding better and faster ways to solve those problems as a group.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

   - The more diverse the company is, the more diverse their user base will be. For example, if a company is lacking engagement from the Latino community, that company probably needs more Latino's working on solving that problem to effectively engage more Latino users.
