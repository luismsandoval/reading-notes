# Trees

## WHY

- A tree data structure is a type of data structure that allows you to store and organize data in a hierarchical way, with a set of nodes arranged in a tree-like structure.

## WHAT

- A tree data structure consists of a set of nodes, where each node has a value and may have zero or more children nodes. The nodes are arranged in a tree-like structure, with the top node called the root node and the other nodes branching off from it.

## HOW

- To use a tree data structure, you can create a tree by defining the root node and adding children nodes to it. You can traverse the tree by starting at the root node and visiting each of the children nodes in turn. You can also search the tree by starting at the root node and traversing the tree until you find the node you are looking for.
