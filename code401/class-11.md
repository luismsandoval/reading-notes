# Event Driven Applications

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

   - The `events` module. It provides the `EventEmitter` class.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) and event-driven programming are often used together because OOP provides a way to organize code into modular and self-contained objects, and event-driven programming allows the application to react to external events in a flexible and scalable way. Together, they can help build well-organized, modular, and scalable applications.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

   - It can be used in the backend with Node.js to handle requests from clients, execute long-running tasks, and more. It helps build efficient and scalable backend applications.
