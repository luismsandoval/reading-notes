# Context API

## ReactJS docs

1. What can React Context provide your app?

   - A way to share values between components without having to pass a prop through every level.

2. Why might we use Context?

   - When we need to share data that can be considered "global".

3. Why should we use it sparingly?

   - It makes component reuse more difficult.
