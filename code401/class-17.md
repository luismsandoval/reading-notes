2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

   - A CDN works by storing copies of website content on servers that are distributed across the internet, and then delivering that content to website visitors from the server that is closest to their location, which helps to improve the speed and performance of the website.

3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

   - The benefits of employing a CDN include improved website performance and user experience, reduced strain on the origin server, and increased protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
