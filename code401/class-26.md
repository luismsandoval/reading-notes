# Component Based UI

## react hello world

1. What are the building blocks of a React app?

   - _Elements_ and _Components_

2. What is the difference between an element and a React component?

   - An element describes what you want to see on the screen. Components are made up of elements. Components are independent, reusable pieces of UI.

3. What are some advantages of Reactâ€™s component based architecture?

   - The components are independent and reusable.

## introducing JSX

1. What is JSX and why do we use it?

   - A syntax extension to JS. Used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

2. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.

   - You place any valid JS expression inside curly brackets. i.e. `<h1> Hello {name} </h1>`

3. Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.

   - Yes! React DOM _escapes_ any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. You can never inject something that is not explicitly written in your app.

## rendering elements

1. Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.

   - A component is a collection of elements that make up a piece of UI.

2. Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?

   - React elements are immutable. The only way to update the UI is to rerender the component.

3. If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?

   - Only the node whose contents have changed get updated by React DOM.
