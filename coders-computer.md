# The Coders Computer
Luis Sandoval Code 102
## What makes a computer a *Coder's Computer*?
The main thing that makes a coders computer is the tool that that developer uses. This tool is known as a *text editor*. So long as any text editor is installed on the computer, that devoloper can work.

## Well, what's a *text editor*?
Exactly what it sounds like. It is a software that can used on your computer that allows you to write and manage text. This is especially important for devolopers that need to write code.
#### What should I look for in a text editor?
Here are some important feature to look out for:
- Code completion
  - This feature acts almost like a *predictive text* to make writing code faster and easier.
- Sytax highlighting
  - This takes all of your text and colorizes it. The distinction between colors helps make text easier to read and easier to find errors.
- Variety of themes
  - The use of themes allows for customization of your terminal. This can change the color of the background, text, et cetera to something more to your liking. Personally, I'm a dark mode kind of guy. This is going to not only personalize your workspace but can reduce eye strain as well.
- Extensions
  - The ability to add *plug-ins* to your text editor can help allow you to do things that you would not have been able to do otherwise. This means as your needs change, your text editor has the capability to change with it.
