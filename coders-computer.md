# The Coders Computer

## What makes a computer a *Coder's Computer*?
The main thing that makes a coders computer is the tool that that developer uses. This tool is known as a *text editor*. So long as any text editor is installed on the computer, that devoloper can work.

### Well, what's a *text editor*?
Exactly what it sounds like. It is a software that can used on your computer that allows you to write and manage text. This is especially important for devolopers that need to write code.
### What should I look for in a text editor?
Here are some important feature to look out for:
- Code completion
  - This feature acts almost like a *predictive text* to make writing code faster and easier.
- Sytax highlighting
  - This takes all of your text and colorizes it. The distinction between colors helps make text easier to read and easier to find errors.
- Variety of themes
  - The use of themes allows for customization of your terminal. This can change the color of the background, text, et cetera to something more to your liking. Personally, I'm a dark mode kind of guy. This is going to not only personalize your workspace but can reduce eye strain as well.
- Extensions
  - The ability to add *plug-ins* to your text editor can help allow you to do things that you would not have been able to do otherwise. This means as your needs change, your text editor has the capability to change with it.

It is inherent that you choose the right software for you. This can depend on a number of different factors including the coding language you will be using and the operating system on your computer. No one text editor is perfect, so try them all out and see what works best for you!

### Here are some basic navigation commands and paths we can try in our terminal to help us move around files:

- pwd: The *present working directory* command is going to tell you in what directory you are currently located in.
- ls: The *list* command will list all of the contents of a directory.
- ls -a: This command differs from the latter because this command lists all of the contents of a directory *including* hidden files.
- cd: The *change direction* command allows the user to move to a different directory.
- file: The *file* command gives you information on what *type* of file a file is.
- ~(tilde): This is a shortcut to your home directory. 
- .(dot): This refers to the current directory.
- ..(dotdot): This refers to the previous directory (or parent directory).
- ""(quotes): Anything inside quotes is considered a single item.
- /(backslash): This *escape character* nulifies the special meaning of the next character.

### Remember these important concepts!

- **Relative path**: A file relative to where we are *currently*.
- **Absolute path**: A file relative to the root of the file system. (/)
- **Everything is a file.** Yes, even directories.
- **Linux is extensionless.** Files do not need any extension.
- ***LINUX IS CASE SENSITIVE***
