# HTML

You can think of HTML as the bare bones of a website. It is only what gives the website structure, so it won't look too pretty.

## Wireframe

A wireframe is a "rough-draft" which allows designers to plan the design for a website before just jumping straight in.

**Here is an example of what one might look like:**

Here are some ways that designers can structure their process. Remember that every project is different and some will require more planning then others.

- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
- Sketch > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

### 6 Steps to Make your Wireframe

1. **Research:** Understand your audience and industry.
2. **Quick Reference Guide:** After all of that research, make sure you have the most important details at hands reach for quick reference. Unless you have big brain and can remember everything, this will be extremely helpful.
3. **Map out User Flow:** You must have a clear idea of where you expect the user to navigate from and to naturally. This is called the user flow.
4. **Draft and Sketch:** Do not draw. Do not illustrate. Remember that we need a clean, easy to understand wireframe to follow.
5. **Add detail:** Now after the pages are made we can add some detail from top to bottom, left to right. Usability conventions like where to put the nav bar, et cetera. This will connect "form and functionality."
6. **Prototype:** Now we can turn our wireframe into a working prototype!

### Wireframe Principles

1. Clarity
2. Confidence
3. Simplicity

## So what's HTML?

"A *markup language* that defines the structure of your content" HTML uses **elements** to wrap content and make it appear or act different than plain text.

### What does an element consist of?

1. **The opening tag:** This tells us where the element begins.
2. **The closing tag:** This tells us where the element ends.
3. **The content:** The content of the element, anything between the opening and closing tags.
4. **The element:** The latter three together make up the element.

### Nesting elements

We can use an element inside another element. This is called nesting. It will look something like this:

```
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
```

### Empty elements

These elements have no content.

```
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
```
